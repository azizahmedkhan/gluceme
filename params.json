{"name":"Gluceme","tagline":"Brainstorming Ideas for startup @UDACITY","body":"###Brainstorm\r\n\r\n- **Idea 1: Seeing bus route on mobile**\r\n\tWaiting for a bus is sometimes frustrating. We leave office to catch the bus and ended up waiting for the bus in the rain. If busses location can be shared in a map, we can leave our home or office on right time. We should also be able to give stop signal to the bus from our mobile application.\r\n\r\n- **Idea 2: Paying bills by a click**\r\n\tWe get at least three bills every month, login to websites, providing bill info and making payment is kind of repetitive tasks and sometimes feels boring. There are automatic payment options available but they lack visibility as payees still needs to check their bank statements to know how much they are charged.\r\nThere should be an app which scans emails and grabs latest bill from that. The app will have card details securely stored. Upon receiving any preconfigured type bill in an email, it will show a popup showing type and amount of bill and it will ask if the user wants to pay it now. Upon getting consent from the user, the app will pay the bill right away.\r\n\r\n- **Idea 3: Restaurant Buzzer**\r\n\tUpon ordering a meal in restaurants they provide a buzzer, which they ring when the order is ready. The buzzer can be replaced by a simple smartphone app which will receive the notification from the restaurant kitchen.\r\n\r\n- **Idea 4: Digital menu**\r\n\tRestaurant menus are printed on papers are hard to change, keeping same restaurant menu for a long time may become boring. Also, it does not allow any customization or adding any preferences on food items.\r\n\tThere can be an app which represents restaurant’s menu on the smartphone of the diner. Restaurant management can change the menu as frequent as they wish. Also, diners can ask for their preferences about food.\r\n\r\n- **Idea 5: Sixth Coffee**\r\n\tMany coffee shops keep track of coffees a customer drinks with them and they don’t charge them their customer sixth coffee. Those coffee shops usually provide their customers a card which customer needs to present on every order. People ended up carrying multiple cards for each coffee shop and restaurant.\r\nThere can be an app built for the smartphone to replace those cards, people visiting cafes and restaurants can simply tap their mobile phone to add their order to their orders list.\r\n\r\n- **Idea 6: Proactive Glossary**\r\n\tWe need specific items for glossary after some specific time. This app will find out user’s preference once and will ask the user if they want to order those glossaries. The app will also keep learning user’s preferences and will keep giving suggestions.\r\n\r\n###Problem and Solution Statement\r\n\r\n**Gluceme**\r\nOrdering coffee on a daily basis at a cafe can be a frustrating experience. Having to inform the barista of your preference on every single visit can get annoying and occasionally missing your name being called out are just a few of the problems cafe-goers encounter. Cafe menus also tend to be less informative and are difficult to change for cafe owners.\r\nGluceme will enable cafe's to publish menus, receive orders and notify customers of their orders and manage customer loyalty through the app.\r\nBased on user suggestions, we have added a function that enables users to pay through the app.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
